# Day 1 Journal - LinkedIn Job Application Assistant

**Date**: August 4, 2025

**What I Did Today**:

- Set up a React-based Chrome extension scaffold.
- Inspected LinkedIn DOM to find job title, company, and link selectors.
- Created a content script to detect job pages and log data.
- Built a basic popup UI with React, including a "Save Job" button.
- Fixed file structure issues (e.g., content.js placement).

**Challenges**:

- Struggled with content.js not appearing in build/—resolved by manual copying.
- Initially checked the wrong console for the "Save Job" button log—found it in the popup console.

**Next Steps**:

- Connect content.js to the popup to show real job data.
- Enhance the UI with AI features (e.g., job matching).
